## Steiner Tree Problem
Given a graph and a subset of vertices in the graph, a steiner tree spans though the given subset. The Steiner Tree may contain some vertices which are not in given subset but are used to connect the vertices of subset.
The given set of vertices is called Terminal Vertices and other vertices that are used to construct Steiner tree are called Steiner vertices.
Finding out Minimum Spanning Tree is polynomial time solvable, but Minimum Steiner Tree problem is NP Hard and related decision problem is NP-Complete.
